- I’m interested in cybersecurity ([PKCS

  Testing](https://github.com/markkurossi/pkcs11-testing),
  [PAM](https://github.com/markkurossi/pam-cert)), cryptography
  ([MPC](https://github.com/markkurossi/mpc),
  [Ciphers](https://github.com/markkurossi/crypto-modes)), programming
  languages ([Scheme](https://github.com/markkurossi/scheme),
  [WebAssembly](https://github.com/markkurossi/wasm),
  [MPCL](https://github.com/markkurossi/mpc),
  [IQL](https://github.com/markkurossi/iql),
  [Datalog](https://github.com/markkurossi/datalog)), interpreters,
  virtual machines, and everything new
- I’m currently learning what's new in cryptography, especially
  multi-party computation and FHE

  safer place
