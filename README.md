- Hi, I’m @markkurossi
- I’m interested in cybersecurity (PKCS #11
  [Provider](https://github.com/markkurossi/pkcs11-provider) /
  [Testing](https://github.com/markkurossi/pkcs11-testing),
  [PAM](https://github.com/markkurossi/pam-cert), [Privileged Access
  Management](https://github.com/markkurossi/open-pam)), cryptography
  ([MPC](https://github.com/markkurossi/mpc),
  [Ciphers](https://github.com/markkurossi/crypto-modes)), programming
  languages ([Scheme](https://github.com/markkurossi/scheme),
  [WebAssembly](https://github.com/markkurossi/wasm),
  [MPCL](https://github.com/markkurossi/mpc),
  [IQL](https://github.com/markkurossi/iql),
  [Datalog](https://github.com/markkurossi/datalog),
  [Go](https://github.com/markkurossi/tabulate),
  [JSONQ](https://github.com/markkurossi/jsonq),
  [C](https://github.com/markkurossi/stacktrace),
  [Java](https://github.com/markkurossi/jot)), interpreters, virtual
  machines, and everything old and new
  ([VPN](https://github.com/markkurossi/vpn),
  [ASCII](https://github.com/markkurossi/ascii-art),
  [VT100](https://github.com/markkurossi/vt100),
  [Arduino](https://github.com/markkurossi/arduino))
- I’m currently learning what's new in cryptography, especially
  [multi-party computation](https://github.com/markkurossi/mpc) and
  FHE
- I’m looking to collaborate on things that make the digital world a
  safer place
